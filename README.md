#🏥 Healthcare Interoperability Solution using the Pub/Sub Pattern

##📖 Overview

This project was developed for the **Software Architecture** course (2025) as a practical implementation of the **Publisher–Subscriber (Pub/Sub)** architectural pattern.

The objective is to solve an interoperability issue within a healthcare company that manages Electronic Health Records (EHR), laboratory results, and appointment scheduling systems.

The solution applies the Pub/Sub pattern within a Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) and aligns with Event-Driven Architecture (EDA) principles.

#🚨 Problem Statement


A healthcare company manages:
•	Laboratory Results Service
•	Appointment Scheduling Service
•	Electronic Medical Records Service

These systems operate independently without standardized communication.

### Identified Issues
•	❌ Data inconsistencies
•	❌ Duplicate records
•	❌ Delayed clinical updates
•	❌ Lack of synchronization between services
•	❌ Risk to patient data confidentiality

### Example Scenario

When a laboratory result is generated:
•	The medical history is not updated immediately.
•	The appointment scheduling system is not synchronized.
•	Doctors and patients experience delays accessing clinical information.

#🎯 Objectives

## General Objective

Implement a service-based architectural pattern to solve interoperability issues in electronic health record management.

## Specific Objectives
•	Standardize medical information exchange.
•	Improve efficiency in medical data sharing.
•	Eliminate inconsistencies and duplication.
•	Enable asynchronous communication between services.

#🧩 Selected Pattern: Publisher–Subscriber (Pub/Sub)

### The Publisher–Subscriber (Pub/Sub) pattern is a messaging architecture pattern that:

•	Decouples message producers (publishers) from message consumers (subscribers).
•	Uses a message broker as an intermediary.
•	Enables asynchronous communication.
•	Supports scalability and flexibility.

### Core Concept

Instead of direct service-to-service communication:
1.	A Publisher emits an event.
2.	A Broker distributes the event.
3.	Multiple Subscribers react independently.

This ensures loose coupling and system scalability.

### Architecture Components
•	**Publisher** – Emits domain events (e.g., NewLabResultGenerated)
•	**Message Broker** – Routes and distributes events
•	**Subscribers** – Services reacting to events:
o	Medical History Service
o	Appointment Scheduling Service
o	Notification Service

#🔄 Interaction Flow

## Interaction Flow Diagram

### Behavioral Cycle
1.	Subscribers register interest in specific events.
2.	A domain change occurs (e.g., lab result uploaded).
3.	The Publisher emits an event.
4.	The Broker distributes the event.
5.	Each Subscriber reacts independently:
o	Update records
o	Schedule appointments
o	Notify doctor
o	Alert patient
o	Log event

#🏥 Application in the Healthcare Scenario

### When a clinical laboratory result is generated:
•	The system publishes the event NewLabResultGenerated.
•	The broker distributes it to:
o	Medical History Service
o	Appointment Scheduling Service
o	Notification Service

### Results Achieved
✔ Near real-time synchronization
✔ Elimination of data duplication
✔ Faster access to clinical information
✔ Improved patient and doctor experience

#🌍 Architectural Context

## Event-Driven Architecture (EDA)
This solution aligns with Event-Driven Architecture principles:
•	Systems react to domain events.
•	Events are immutable.
•	Communication is asynchronous.
•	Services do not directly depend on each other.

### Example Event
Event: NewLabResultGenerated
**Reactions:**
•	Update medical history
•	Notify doctor
•	Send alert to patient
